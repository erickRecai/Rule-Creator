# Rule-Creator
A userscript that makes creating various rules somewhat easily from selected text.  
  
Plainly, this script merely just appends some text to the front and end of the selected text and copies it to your clipboard.

# Installation
Requires a browser extension that enables userscripts to install this userscript. I personally use Tampermonkey but other extensions should work as well.  
* Chrome:  
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en  
* Firefox:  
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/  
To install this script specifically, just the <code>user.js</code> file needs to downloaded.
